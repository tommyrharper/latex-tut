Hello! This is my first \LaTeX\ document.

A rectangle has side lengths of $(x+1)$ and $(x+3)$.
The equation $${A(x)=x^2+4x+3}$$ gives the area of the rectangle. You can see how the use of the double dollar sign places the math equation into its full own line.\\

If I write an equation with a single dollar sign it goes inline $x+y^2+z=1x+y+\cos 3$. You can see how it wraps around.\\

If I add curly brackets you can how it goes on a new line instead ${x+y^2+z=1x+y+\cos 3}$. It doesn't wrap around.\\

By default the first line of a paragraph is indented.
If I add a single newline, it continues on the same line.

If I add two newlines, it goes onto the next line but indents.\\
If I add a single newline and double slashes, it goes onto a new line, but doesn't indent.\\

If I add double slashes and a double newline, it adds a full space and indents again.
